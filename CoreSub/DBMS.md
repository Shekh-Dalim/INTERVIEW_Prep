        Data Integrity â€“ Ensures accuracy and consistency of data.
        Backup and Recovery â€“ Automatically saves and restores data.
        Reduces Data Redundancy â€“ Avoids storing the same data multiple times.
        Easy Data Access â€“ Simple to search, update, or delete data.
        ```


ðŸŸ¢2. What is a Database?
```
    A database is a organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
    ```

ðŸŸ¢3. Define a Database System.
```
    A Database System is a combination of the database, DBMS , and the applications used 
    to access and manage the data.
    ```

ðŸŸ¢4. What is RDBMS? Mention its properties.
```
    RDBMS stand for Relational Database Management System
    RDBMS is a type of DBMS that stores data in tables (rows and columns) and uses relationships between them.

    Properties of RDBMS:
        Tables â€“ Data is stored in rows and columns.
        Keys â€“ Uses primary keys and foreign keys to link tables.
        Data Integrity â€“ Ensures accuracy and consistency.
        ACID Properties â€“ Maintains reliable transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
        SQL Support â€“ Uses SQL to manage and query data.
        ```
    
ðŸŸ¢5. What are the types of database languages?
```
    DDL (Data Definition Language)
        â€“ Used to create and modify database structure.
        â€“ Example: CREATE, ALTER, DROP

    DML (Data Manipulation Language)
        â€“ Used to insert, update, delete, or retrieve data.
        â€“ Example: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

    DCL (Data Control Language)
        â€“ Used to control access and permissions.
        â€“ Example: GRANT, REVOKE

    TCL (Transaction Control Language)
        â€“ Used to manage transactions in the database.
        â€“ Example: COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT
        ```

ðŸŸ¢6. Explain ACID properties.
```
    ACID Properties
    ACID ensures that database transactions are reliable and safe.

    ðŸ”¹ A â€“ Atomicity
        A transaction is all or nothing.
        ðŸ§  If one part fails, the whole transaction is rolled back.

    ðŸ”¹ C â€“ Consistency
        Keeps the database in a valid state.
        ðŸ§  Data always follows rules and constraints.

    ðŸ”¹ I â€“ Isolation
        Transactions run independently of each other.
        ðŸ§  One transaction doesnâ€™t affect another running at the same time.

    ðŸ”¹ D â€“ Durability
        Once a transaction is committed, the data is saved permanently, even after a crash.
        ðŸ§  Changes wonâ€™t be lost.
        ```

ðŸŸ¢7. Difference between vertical and horizontal scaling.
```
    
         Vertical Scaling	                      Horizontal Scaling

    ```

ðŸŸ¢8. What is sharding in DBMS?
```
     Sharding is a method of splitting a large database into smaller parts, called shards,
     so that each shard can be stored on a different server.

    ðŸ§  Think: Breaking one big book into smaller chapters and storing them in different places to make reading faster.
    ```

ðŸŸ¢9. What are Keys in DBMS?
```
     Keys are special fields in a table used to identify rows and create relationships between tables.

    âœ… Common Types of Keys:
        Primary Key â€“ Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
        Foreign Key â€“ Connects one table to another.
        Candidate Key â€“ All possible unique keys; one becomes the primary key.
        Composite Key â€“ A key made from two or more columns.
        Unique Key â€“ Ensures all values in a column are different.
        ```

ðŸŸ¢10. Types of Relationships in DBMS.

        Logical Level â€“ Describes what data is stored and the relationships (tables, columns).
        View Level â€“ Shows only part of the data to the user (like a custom report).
        ```

ðŸŸ¢12. What is Indexing in DBMS? Why Use Indexing?

```
     DDL is a set of SQL commands used to define or change the structure of database
     objects like tables, schemas, or indexes.

    ðŸ§  Think: DDL is used to create and organize your database layout.

    âœ… Common DDL Commands:
        CREATE â€“ Makes a new table or database

            2NF: Removes partial dependency; applies only to tables with composite keys.
            3NF: Removes transitive dependency; non-key columns depend only on the primary key.
            BCNF: A stronger version of 3NF; every determinant is a candidate key.
            ```



ðŸŸ¢16. What is Denormalization?
```
      Denormalization is the process of adding redundant data to a database to improve read
      performance by reducing the number of joins. It is the opposite of normalization.
      ```

ðŸŸ¢17. What is Functional Dependency?
```
        Functional dependency is a relationship where one column's value depends on another column.
        If A â†’ B, it means the value of A uniquely determines the value of B.
        ```

      ```

ðŸŸ¢20. Explain Normal Forms in DBMS.
```
      Normal forms are rules used to organize database tables to reduce data 
      redundancy and improve data integrity.

      The main normal forms are:
        1NF: Removes repeating groups; each cell has a single value.
        2NF: Removes partial dependency; applies only to tables with composite keys.
        3NF: Removes transitive dependency; non-key columns depend only on the primary key.
        BCNF: A stronger version of 3NF; every determinant is a candidate key. 
        ```

ðŸŸ¢21. What is CCP (Concurrency Control Protocols)?

      and its result is used by the outer query. Also called subqueries.
      ```

ðŸŸ¢25. What is a JOIN in SQL? Explain its types.
```
      A JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
      
    Types of JOINs:
        INNER JOIN: Returns only matching rows from both tables.
        LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
        RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
        FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows when there is a match in either table.
        ```

ðŸŸ¢26. What are Inner and Outer Joins?
```

    Inner Join: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.

    Outer Join: Returns matching rows plus rows with no match from one or both tables.

    Types of Outer Join:
        Left Outer Join: All rows from left table + matched rows from right.
        Right Outer Join: All rows from right table + matched rows from left.
        Full Outer Join: All rows from both tables, matched or not.
