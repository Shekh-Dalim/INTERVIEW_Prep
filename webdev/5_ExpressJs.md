  1: Why should we used express ?
  2: Why Nodemon ?
  3: Install Express@4
  4: Request parameters and queries
  5: static Files


  ✨ Why Do We Use Express.js (Even with Next.js)?
1. Custom Server Logic
```
Express.js allows full control over custom server logic, routes, and middlewares that go beyond what Next.js provides out of the box.

Example: handling custom APIs, file uploads, complex auth flows, etc.
```
2. Advanced Middleware Handling
```
Express has a powerful middleware system to handle authentication, logging, CORS, and error handling smoothly.

You can insert any logic before request reaches your main route/API.
```
3. API Gateway / Proxy Handling
```
Express can be used as an API gateway to route requests to different services or microservices.

Useful for handling backend-for-frontend scenarios.
```
4. Better Control Over Server
```
When using Express with Next.js in custom server mode, you get control over request-response cycles.

Perfect when you need to merge traditional backend logic with frontend rendering.
```
5. Easy Integration with Databases & Other Tools
```
Express integrates smoothly with MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, etc.

Also useful for connecting to 3rd-party APIs, payment gateways, and background jobs.
```
6. Real-time Capabilities
```
Can be easily combined with Socket.IO or WebSockets for real-time apps like chats or live notifications.
```
7. Scalable and Lightweight
```
Minimal and unopinionated, making it easier to structure backend logic as per your app’s needs without restrictions.
```
8. Production Use-Cases
```
In real-world projects, Express is often used with Next.js for handling server-side rendering + backend APIs in a single server.

✅ Example Use Case:

“In my project, we used Next.js for frontend and SSR, but used Express.js to build custom APIs for authentication, image uploads, and database interaction. This helped us separate concerns and maintain scalable backend logic.”


why middle ware used in express point wise as per interviewr ask


ChatGPT said:
Here’s a point-wise answer to why middleware is used in Express.js, perfect for interviews:

Code Reusability – Middleware lets you reuse code (like logging, authentication) across routes.

Request Processing – It can modify req and res objects (e.g., parse JSON, add user info).

Error Handling – Middleware can handle errors centrally, improving code structure.

Access Control – Helps with authentication and authorization before hitting route handlers.

Logging & Monitoring – Logs request data for debugging or analytics.

Third-party Integration – Allows use of middleware like body-parser, cors, morgan, etc.

Layered Architecture – Keeps route logic clean and separates concerns.

🟦 1. What is Express.js?
```
Answer: Express.js is a web framework for Node.js used to build fast and easy web applications and APIs.
```
🟦 2. Why use Express.js?
```
Answer: It’s simple, fast, has many features, and makes building web apps easier.
```
🟦 3. What is middleware in Express.js?
```
Answer: Middleware is a function that runs between the request and response. It can change data, check login, or handle errors.
```
🟦 4. Why is middleware used?
```

Reuse common code

Modify request/response

Handle errors

Check user access

Add logs or headers
```
🟦 5. What is routing in Express.js?
```
Answer: Routing means handling different URLs and deciding what to do when a user visits them.
```
🟦 6. How to define a route in Express?
```

app.get("/home", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Welcome");
});
```
🟦 7. What is req and res in Express?
```

req: Request object (from user)

res: Response object (to send back)
```
🟦 8. What is next() in middleware?
```
Answer: It passes control to the next middleware. Without it, the request stops.
```
🟦 9. What is the difference between app.use() and app.get()?
```

app.use() → for middleware

app.get() → for GET routes
```
10. How to serve static files in Express?
```

app.use(express.static("public"));
(Serves files from "public" folder)
```
🟦 11. What is body-parser?
```
Answer: Middleware to read data from the request body (like JSON or forms).
```
🟦 12. How to handle errors in Express?
```
Answer: Use an error-handling middleware:

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(500).send("Error happened");
});
```
🟦 13. What is express.Router()?
```
Answer: A mini Express app for grouping routes together.
```
14. What is CORS in Express?
```
Answer: It allows or blocks requests from other domains (cross-origin).
```
🟦 15. How to enable CORS in Express?
```
const cors = require("cors");
app.use(cors());

```
16. Can we build REST API with Express?
```
Answer: Yes! Express is perfect for building RESTful APIs.
```
🟦 17. What is the default port of Express app?
```
Answer: Express does not have a fixed default, but developers often use 3000.
