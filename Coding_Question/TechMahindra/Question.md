1. Here are some Tech Mahindra Coding Questions from 2020 which are solved in C: Build a program for calculating and returning the sums of absolute differences between adjacent numbers in arrays of positive integers. This must be calculated from the position determined by the current user.

In the case of this coding problem, you use three positional arguments through a findTotalSum function. The three inputs you would require are the number of elements inside the array, the elements in the array and the position from where this function will take place.

For example, suppose the total number of elements is 5 and these are the elements:

1 2 3 6 4

Then, if we decide to start from the 3rd position or enter 3 as input, the function will occur from â€˜3â€™, the 3rd number in the array.


Hence, the sum would be a total of (6-3)+(4-6)= 5


2. Build a program that will allow you to find out how many clothing pieces in total of a certain length can be extracted from a particular number of cloth pieces. We can take the required length for each clothing piece as 10 feet.

In this case, we must first decide upon the length unit as feet and determine the inputs we need. For this function, we will need two inputs, first the number of pieces ( in the array) and the size of each piece in feet inside the array. 

A cloth merchant has some pieces of cloth of different lengths. He has an order of curtains of length 12 feet. He has to find how many curtains can be made from these pieces. Length of pieces of cloth is recorded in feet. 

For example, suppose the total number of elements is 3 and these are the elements:

0 10 40

Then, the first input is 3 followed by the second input of 0, 10 and 40.

Hence, the sum would be a total of 0 + (10/10) + (40/10) = 5

Thus, there could be 5 pieces of clothing extracted from these 3 pieces of cloth of variable sizes.


Here are some more previous Tech Mahindra coding questions with answers in C++:

1. Calculate the total interest on loans for an array of amounts. However, till the amount of 2000, there is no interest applicable, but, there is a 20% interest applicable for the remaining amounts in the array.

In this case, we will be writing a calculate TotalInterest function that receives the first input as the number of amounts in the array and the second input as the array of amounts.

For instance, if there are 5 amounts with the first input as 5 and the amounts being 2000, 4000, 6000, 8000 and 10000.

The total sum would be = 20% of 4000 + 20% of 6000 + 20% of 8000 + 20% of 10000 = 5600 (as the 2000 will not be considered for interest)

2. Write code for returning the differences between the sums of even and odd numbers in an array of positive integers.

In this case, we will be writing a calculateOddEvenDifference function that receives the first input as the number of positive integers in the array and the second input as the array of positive integers.

For instance, if there are 4 numbers as the first input and the numbers are 13, 8, 9 and 4, the difference of the sum of odd numbers and the sum of even numbers would be = (13+9) â€“ (8+4) = 22 â€“ 12 = 10
